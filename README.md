# MC-Plugins
Various Minecraft plugins created for a public minecraft server that I hosted from 2014-2018.
Note:
- Much of this is outdated and was created during my pre-teen years, code has not been updated in years.
- Utilized APIs and listeners availabled to the public.
- No longer updated to working versions of minecraft.

Server Information: 
- Playerbase ranging from 100-350 during peak hours
- Server gamemode initially began with "Prison", where users would start at a low tier rank and work their way up via mining valuable ores and selling them, in order to garner enough currency to rank up to further ranks. Eventually being able to "escape" prison. Other gamemodes were created later down the line.
- Hosted using OVH dedicated servers, using MySQL for UUID databases and other plugin dependencies.
